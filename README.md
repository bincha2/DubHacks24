Use Case:
Many people want to eat healthy but may not know where to start. 
They may have ingredients at home available that they never would have thought could be used to make healthy food with.
People also may have health issues such as high blood pressure , and other conditions that require them to track their diet/macros as well.
We wanted to develop something that could streamline this process, as well as track data.

Our Idea:
Health and Wellness app designed to take user input, such as ingredients available, dietary restrictions (allergies, gluten free, etc) 
and generate healthy recipes based on these inputs.
Once generated, user can choose out of the recipe options, than the website shall store it in a database. 
The data base will hold the recipe, as well as the macro-nutrient/nutrional stats of the ingredients in the given recipe. 
This database will continuously store and allow the user to track their macros, allowing them clear insight on what they are making and eating.
The user will have an option to see their macro stats (not yet implemented)

Tech Used:
Front-end: Figma, JavaScript, HTML/CSS 
Back-end: Flask, Cloudflare Workers Ai API w Llama 3-8b Instruct LLM for custom prompted outputs
Database: MongoDB or MySQl or something else (not yet implemented)

Was able to implement the proto-type of our web-app, integrating a fully working & responding GenAi with user inputs. 50% Done. 
Next, update UI + Integrate DataBase + displaying nutrients
